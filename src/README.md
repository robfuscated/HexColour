# HexColour - Hex Editor/Viewer/Analyzer
 

HexColour is a very simple fork of HexWalk which is based on qHexEdit2, but i've reorganised the user interface to put more of a focus on the byte patterns functionality.
When reverse engineering file formats, I find that i usually end up doing one of two things:

1. Copy byte snippets from HxD to a text editor and annotate what i think are fields with comments at the end of each line
2. Take a screenshot of the HxD window and use the highlighter tool to colour code fields.

I thought that there must be a better way of doing this, and HexWalk was the best hex editor I could find that had the functionality I was looking for.
Obviously once the file format has been reverse engineered you will want to switch to something like Kaitai Struct or the Python Construct library, but while you are in the trial and error stage this could be a good option.
